A comprehensive computer vision project that uses a two-stage YOLOv8 pipeline to first identify industrial tools and machinery, and then inspect them for common faults and breakdowns. This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow from data collection and annotation to training, evaluation, and pipeline deployment.

## üéØ Project Overview

In industrial environments, the ability to quickly and accurately identify equipment and diagnose potential issues is critical for safety and operational efficiency. This project automates this process using a two-model computer vision pipeline:

1.  **Object Detection Model:** A YOLOv8 model trained on **88 classes** of common industrial tools and machinery. Its job is to answer the question: *"What is this object?"*
2.  **Fault Detection Model:** A second, specialized YOLOv8 model trained to detect common visual defects like `rust`, `leaks`, `cracks`, and `burn marks`. Its job is to answer the question: *"Is there a problem with this object?"*

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Two-Model Pipeline:** Utilizes a sequential inference process for high-accuracy, context-aware fault detection.
* **Custom Datasets:** Built from scratch with two personally annotated datasets for specific industrial use cases.
* **High-Performance Models:** Leverages the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 architecture for fast and accurate detections.
* **Domain-Specific:** Tailored for industrial maintenance, providing a practical solution for real-world challenges.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The system uses a two-pass approach to analyze an image, mimicking the workflow of a human maintenance expert.

1.  **Pass 1: Find the Equipment**
    * The main **Object Detection Model** scans the full image to locate and identify all known tools and machinery.

2.  **Pass 2: Inspect for Faults**
    * For each piece of equipment found in Pass 1, its bounding box is cropped from the main image.
    * This smaller, cropped image is then fed into the specialized **Fault Detection Model**.
    * The fault model's only task is to find defects *within* that specific piece of equipment, which greatly improves accuracy and reduces false positives.

3.  **Final Output**
    * The results are combined to produce a final, annotated image showing both the identified equipment (e.g., in a green box) and any detected faults (e.g., in a red box).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* PyTorch
* An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA (recommended for performance)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Your Repository Name]
    ```

2.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install ultralytics matplotlib opencv-python
    ```

### Usage

1.  Place your trained model weights (`object_model_best.pt` and `fault_model_best.pt`) in a `weights/` directory.
2.  Place the images you want to test in an `input_images/` directory.
3.  Run the inference pipeline script:
    ```bash
    python run_pipeline.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
    ```

## üîÆ Future Improvements

* **Deployment as a Web App:** Package the pipeline into a Flask or FastAPI web application for easy use.
* **Real-Time Video Processing:** Adapt the script to run on a live video feed from an IP camera for continuous monitoring.
* **Expand Fault Classes:** Collect more data for rarer and more subtle defect types to further improve the model's diagnostic capabilities.
